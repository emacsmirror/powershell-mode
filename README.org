powershell-mode

A simple mode for editing Powershell code in Emacs.

This mode was written from scratch, without using Vivek Sharma's mode
of the same name.

This is still pretty basic: there is indentation, syntax
hilighting, speedbar/imenu support. The indentation is pretty na√Øve
but robust, and sufficient for my current needs.
