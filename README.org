powershell-mode -- A simple mode for editing Powershell code in Emacs.

* Description

This mode was written from scratch, without using Vivek Sharma's mode
of the same name.

This is still pretty basic: there is indentation, syntax
hilighting, speedbar/imenu support. The indentation is pretty na√Øve
but robust, and sufficient for my current needs.

I am not likely to keep on developing this mode, as I'm no longer a
user of Powershell.

See the initial [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.sources/3383][Announcing a Powershell mode for Emacs]] post on
=emacs.sources=.

* Installation

The code is [[http://svn.fperrin.net/powershell-mode/][kept in my SVN repository]], with [[http://gitweb.fperrin.net/?p=powershell-mode.git][a git mirror]] available.
Retreive the =.el= file and put it somewhere in your [[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki?LoadPath][=load-path=]]. Add
the following to your =.emacs=:

    : (autoload 'powershell-mode "powershell-mode" "Mode PowerShell" t)
    : (push '("\\.ps[12]?$" . powershell-mode) auto-mode-alist)
